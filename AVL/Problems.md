## Question 1 
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) that may be unbalanced, your task is to balance it. A balanced BST is defined as a tree where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4] or Output: [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct
```
Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105

## Question 2
Determine the node(index) where a given binary is not balanced.

## Question 3
Determine the 2 strings which results into a given concatenated string.

## Question 4
kth smallest string from AVL tree in O(logn).

## Question 5
Sorted array of strings to Balanced BST.

## Question 6
Sort a given Linked List and convert to Balanced BST.

## Question 7
Given a Balanced BST T, and two strings s1 and s2 such that s1< s2, write a function that prints all the 
strings in the tree in the range [s1, s2].
